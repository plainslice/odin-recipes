Ingredients:

1 cup of purple flour (made from crushed cosmic crystals)
1/2 cup of stardust
1/4 cup of black hole water
1/4 cup of antimatter sauce
1 cup of galaxy cheese (made from the milk of space cows)
Toppings of your choice (suggestions: moon rocks, comet chunks, or interstellar pepperoni)
Instructions:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the purple flour and stardust. Slowly add in the black hole water and mix until a dough forms.
Knead the dough for 10 minutes, then place it in a warm area to let it rise for 1 hour.
Preheat your antimatter oven to 350 degrees.
Roll out the dough on a pan and spread the antimatter sauce on top.
Sprinkle the galaxy cheese and toppings of your choice on top of the pizza.
Carefully place the pizza in the antimatter oven and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted.
Take the pizza out of the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
Enjoy your cosmic creation!
